# Routing Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem
- The main server (`server.js`) was serving `public/index.html` as the homepage instead of `test-camera-stream-llava.html`
- `camera-viewer.html` needed to be accessible as a settings page

## Solution Applied

### Changes to server.js (lines 75-85)

```javascript
// Specific routes - must come before static file serving
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'test-camera-stream-llava.html'));
});

app.get('/settings', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'camera-viewer.html'));
});

// Static files (dashboard) - serve other public assets but not as homepage
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'), { index: false }));
```

## Key Changes:
1. **Added explicit route for `/`** - Now serves `test-camera-stream-llava.html` as the homepage
2. **Added route for `/settings`** - Serves `camera-viewer.html` as the settings page
3. **Modified static middleware** - Added `{ index: false }` to prevent automatic serving of `index.html`

## Routing Structure After Fix:
- `http://localhost:3000/` → `test-camera-stream-llava.html` (main camera stream page)
- `http://localhost:3000/settings` → `camera-viewer.html` (camera settings page)
- `http://localhost:3000/styles.css` → `public/styles.css` (static assets still work)
- `http://localhost:3000/app.js` → `public/app.js` (static assets still work)
- `http://localhost:3000/index.html` → 404 (public/index.html NOT accessible)

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run the automated test:**
   ```bash
   node test-routing.js
   ```

3. **Manual verification:**
   - Open `http://localhost:3000/` - Should show the camera stream page with LLaVA integration
   - Open `http://localhost:3000/settings` - Should show the camera viewer/settings page
   - Verify that you do NOT see the "Robot Overhead Monitor" dashboard at the homepage

## Notes:
- The `camera-server.js` file already had the correct routing but is not the main server file
- The `package.json` specifies `server.js` as the main entry point
- Other server files (`robot-monitor-server.js`, etc.) have different routing setups but are not the primary server
