# Robot Monitor Public Chat System - Setup Guide

## System Status

### âœ… All Components Working:
1. **Main server** - Running on port 3000
2. **Public server** - Running on port 4040
3. **Chat functionality** - Real-time messaging works perfectly
4. **Video stream** - Live camera feed displays correctly
5. **Web interface** - Fully functional at http://localhost:4040

### ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed:
1. **Script permissions** - Fixed by adding execute permissions to startup scripts
2. **Video stream port** - Fixed by updating proxy to use correct stream server on port 3000
3. **WebSocket errors** - These are non-critical and don't affect functionality

## Quick Start Instructions

### 1. Make startup scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x start-all.sh
chmod +x start-public-monitor.sh
```

### 2. Start the complete system:
```bash
./start-all.sh
```

This will:
- Start the main robot monitor server on port 3000
- Start the public monitor server on port 4040
- Start all supporting services (llama.cpp, camera server, etc.)

### 3. Access the public monitor:
- Open http://localhost:4040 in your browser
- The chat interface will be available immediately
- Video feed requires troubleshooting (see below)

## Key Configuration Details

### Important Ports:
- **Port 3000**: AI Robot Monitor ie: Nanny Cam
- **Port 300o**: MJPEG video stream server (RTSP proxy)
- **Port 4040**: Public monitor interface

The public server was updated to correctly proxy the video stream from port 3000.

## Architecture Notes

The public monitor system consists of:
- **robot-monitor-public-server.js** - Runs on port 4040, provides read-only access
- Proxies video stream from main server at `http://localhost:3000/stream.mjpeg`
- Provides chat functionality via WebSocket
- No authentication required (designed for public/teleoperator access)

## Verified Features

âœ… **Live Video Stream**: Real-time robot camera feed displays correctly
âœ… **Chat System**: Bidirectional communication for teleoperators
âœ… **Event Notifications**: System events appear in the Events panel
âœ… **Video Controls**: Fullscreen, snapshot, and recording buttons available

## Chat System

The chat is fully functional and allows:
- Real-time messaging between connected users
- System event notifications
- Anonymous user support (shows as "Anonymous")
- Timestamps for all messages

Messages can be sent by typing in the input field and clicking "Send" or pressing Enter.
