# LeKiwi Robot Nanny Cam ü§ñü•ù

> *Overhead monitoring system for LeKiwi holonomic robots with 6DOF arms*

A real-time computer vision system that watches LeKiwi robots from above, tracking their movements, arm operations, and ball-in-bucket scoring events in the arena.

## ü§ñ What are LeKiwi Robots?

LeKiwi robots by Hugging Face feature:
- **Holonomic Drive Base**: Tri-wheel omnidirectional movement
- **6DOF Robot Arm**: LeRobot arm mounted on top for manipulation tasks
- **Round Form Factor**: Compact circular design for agile navigation

## üìπ System Overview

The nanny cam system provides:
- **Overhead Camera View**: Wall-mounted camera looking down at the robot arena floor
- **Real-time Robot Tracking**: Monitor multiple LeKiwi robots simultaneously
- **Ball-in-Bucket Scoring**: Automatic point detection when balls enter the white bucket
- **Multi-Model Vision AI**: LLaVA, SmolVLM, and custom model support
- **Remote Access**: Built-in ngrok integration for monitoring from anywhere

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lekiwi-robot-nanny-cam.git
cd lekiwi-robot-nanny-cam

# One button to rule them all
./start-all.sh

# That's it! The system will:
# - Install all dependencies
# - Download AI models
# - Start the camera feed
# - Launch the monitoring interface
```

## üåê Remote Access Setup

Watch your robots from anywhere with automated ngrok setup:

```bash
# Run the automated setup wizard
./setup-ngrok.sh

# Or configure manually if preferred
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

## üìä Features

- **Local**: http://localhost:3000
- **Remote**: Your ngrok URL (shown after running start-all.sh)

### Dashboard Features
- Live camera feed with overlay
- Robot status indicators
- Score counter for ball-in-bucket events
- Model selection dropdown
- Event log and alerts

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Robot Training**: Create datasets for robot manipulation tasks
2. **Competition Monitoring**: Track robot performance in challenges
3. **Research**: Analyze robot behavior patterns
4. **Remote Supervision**: Monitor robot arena from anywhere
5. **Fun**: Keep score of robot basketball games!

## üîß Configuration

### Camera Setup
Edit `config.json` to set your camera URL:
```json
{
  "camera": {
    "url": "rtsp://your-camera-ip/stream"
  }
}
```

### Scoring Zone
The system automatically detects the white bucket. To adjust detection:
- Edit detection parameters in `src/detection/EventDetector.js`
- Modify scoring logic in `src/vision/VisionEngine.js`
