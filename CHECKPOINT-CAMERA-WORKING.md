# CHECKPOINT: Camera Stream Working
Date: 2025-09-13T03:31:19Z

## What Was Fixed
The RTSP camera stream is now working properly after fixing credential issues.

## The Problem
- System was trying to build RTSP URLs dynamically in 85+ places
- Credentials weren't being passed correctly
- Camera was returning 401 Unauthorized errors

## The Solution
Hardcoded the working RTSP URL directly in `rtsp-proxy-debug.js`:
```javascript
const rtspUrl = 'rtsp://LeKiwi:LeKiwi995@192.168.88.40:554/stream1';
```

## Working Configuration
- Camera IP: 192.168.88.40
- Username: LeKiwi
- Password: LeKiwi995
- Stream Path: /stream1
- Full URL: rtsp://LeKiwi:LeKiwi995@192.168.88.40:554/stream1

## Files Modified
1. `rtsp-proxy-debug.js` - Lines 207 and 308 - hardcoded working URL
2. `config.json` - Already had the correct stream_url

## Test Results
✅ Successfully streaming at 15fps
✅ Streamed 90+ frames without issues
✅ Browser can view stream at http://localhost:3000/test-camera-stream.html

## How to Restart Services
```bash
pkill -f "node rtsp-proxy" && pkill -f "node camera-server" && ./start-camera-monitor.sh
```

## Lesson Learned
When you have a working configuration, use it directly instead of overengineering dynamic URL building that can lose critical auth information.
